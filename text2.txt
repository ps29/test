The plot opens by introducing Anna and Kate as sisters. Kate was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia in 1990 and was not responding to treatment or chemotherapy, sparking the need for her to find a suitable donor.
Kate was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia in 1990 and was not responding to treatment or chemotherapy, sparking the need for her to find a suitable donor.
We then learn about Kate’s diagnosis as a baby. The story explores the fact that Anna was a “test tube baby,” conceived to fill the need for a donor to keep her sister alive. Anna is custom-made to be a perfect match for Kate’s medical needs, and from the moment Anna is born, she is pricked, prodded, and cut open in order to donate bone marrow and healthy cells to her sister.
The story then fast forwards 14 years through Kate’s illness and the life of the family. Through these years, we learn about Kate’s unending suffering, as well as the struggles that Sara and Brian face as a couple as a result of their daughter’s illness. We also get the impression that Sara is solely focused on Kate’s struggles and illness, taking attention away from her other children, Jesse and Anna (who is frequently undergoing painful and invasive procedures because of Kate).
The story takes a turn when 13-year-old Anna approaches attorney Campbell Alexander, asking him to represent her while she sues her parents for medical emancipation. Kate is in the final stages of kidney failure, and Anna does not want to give Kate her kidney. Alexander agrees to represent Anna for free.
