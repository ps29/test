This story takes place in Tampa, Florida, where young Georgie is neglected by his mother (an alcoholic) and his mother’s abusive boyfriend, Steve. Georgie lives a tough life, and he experiences a number of problems at school because of his anger issues and learning difficulties. Because of this, he is often ridiculed by his peers.
We soon learn that Georgie does have one comfort in life, which comes in the form of flowers. When he wins a rosebush in a grocery store drawing, he is ecstatic and searches for nearly a day to find somewhere to plant it.
Unable to find a suitable location, he returns home, only to be brutally beaten—almost to death—by Steve. Steve and his mother are taken away by the cops, and Georgie is hospitalized.
A woman from the grocery store offers to look after Georgie while they look for a suitable home, and when he goes to live with her, he is sent to a new school. At his new school and in his new home, he learns to be a healthy human and finally starts to feel happy.
After moving to this new place, his primary concern is with the rosebush, which he kept with him. He is still searching for the perfect place to plant it. Finally, he discovers that the house across the street has a flower garden; however, when he attempts to plant it there, the woman who lives there, Molly Harper, chases him away.
At his new school, Georgie makes friends. He opens up to one of them, Timothy, and talks to him about the hardships he faced at the hands of his mother and Steve. He meets another friend, Robin, who can’t speak. He can only say several words that his brother has taught him. Molly Harper’s father, Mr. Collier, is Robin’s grandfather. Georgie encourages Robin to speak more, and, through this friendship, Georgie becomes closer to Molly Harper.
The story has a tragic end when Robin drowns while trying to feed some ducks. After Robin dies, Georgie plants his rosebush in its final resting place at Robin’s grave.
